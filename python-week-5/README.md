Power Learn Project - Python Assignments
This repository contains my completed assignments for the Power Learn Project Academy's Python course. It serves as a portfolio to showcase my progress and understanding of Python programming concepts.

Week 5 Assignments: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
This section of the repository focuses on assignments from Week 5, which cover core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.

Assignment 1: Designing a Class (assignment.py)
Objective: Design a custom class (Book) with attributes and methods.

Concepts Applied: Class definition, constructors (__init__), object instantiation, and basic methods.

Key Features: The code demonstrates how to create a simple Book class and a child Ebook class that inherits from it, showcasing inheritance and polymorphism.

Assignment 2: Polymorphism (vehicle_polymorphism.py)
Objective: Create a program to demonstrate the concept of polymorphism.

Concepts Applied: Inheritance and method overriding.

Key Features: The program defines a base Vehicle class and several child classes (Car, Plane, Boat). Each child class has its own version of the move() method, highlighting how a single action can have many different forms depending on the object.
